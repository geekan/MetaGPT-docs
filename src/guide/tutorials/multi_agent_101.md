# MultiAgent 101

We briefly discussed the creation of a single agent in last chapter. While a single agent may suffice for many situations, more complex tasks often demand collaboration and teamwork. This is where multiple agents become necessary. The core advantage of MetaGPT also lies in the easy and flexible development of a team of agents. Under MetaGPT framework, users can enable interactions between agents with a minimal amount of codes.

After this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Understand how agents interact with each other
2. Develop your first team of agents

## Run the software startup example

```shell
metagpt --idea "write a cli flappy bird game"
```

## Develop your first team of agents

Hope you find the software startup example enlightenning. Perhaps now you're inspired to develop a team of agents tailored to your unique needs. In this section, we continue with the simple coding example in [Agent101](agent_101) but add more roles to introduce a very basic collaboration.

Together with the coder, let's also hire a tester and a reviewer. This starts to look like a development team, doesn't it? In general, we need three steps to set up the team and make it function:

1. Define each role capable of intended actions
2. Think about the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and ensure each role adhere to it. This is made possible by making each role observe the corresponding output from upstream, and publish its own for the downstream.
3. Initialize all roles, create a team with an environment to put them in, and enable them to interact with each other

Complete code is available at the end of this tutorial

### Define Action and Role

Following the same process as [Agent101](agent_101), we can define three `Role`s with their respective `Action`s:

- A `SimpleCoder` with a `SimpleWriteCode` action, taking instruction from the user and writing the main code
- A `SimpleTester` with a `SimpleWriteTest` action, taking the main code from `SimpleWriteCode` output and providing a test suite for it
- A `SimpleReviewer` with a `SimpleWriteReview` action, reviewing the test cases from `SimpleWriteTest` output and check their coverage and quality

By giving the outline above, we actually make our SOP clear. We will talk about how to set up the `Role` according to it shortly.

#### Define Action

We list the three `Action`s.

````python
from metagpt.actions import Action

class SimpleWriteCode(Action):

    PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
    Write a python function that can {instruction} and provide two runnnable test cases.
    Return ```python your_code_here ``` with NO other texts,
    your code:
    """

    def __init__(self, name="SimpleWriteCode", context=None, llm=None):
        super().__init__(name, context, llm)

    async def run(self, instruction: str):
        prompt = self.PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(instruction=instruction)
        rsp = await self._aask(prompt)
        code_text = parse_code(rsp)
        return code_text
````

````python
class SimpleWriteTest(Action):

    PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
    Context: {context}
    Write {k} unit tests using pytest for the given function, assuming you have imported it.
    Return ```python your_code_here ``` with NO other texts,
    your code:
    """

    def __init__(self, name="SimpleWriteTest", context=None, llm=None):
        super().__init__(name, context, llm)

    async def run(self, context: str, k: int = 3):
        prompt = self.PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(context=context, k=k)
        rsp = await self._aask(prompt)
        code_text = parse_code(rsp)
        return code_text
````

```python
class SimpleWriteReview(Action):

    PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
    Context: {context}
    Review the test cases and provide one critical comments:
    """

    def __init__(self, name="SimpleWriteReview", context=None, llm=None):
        super().__init__(name, context, llm)

    async def run(self, context: str):
        prompt = self.PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(context=context)
        rsp = await self._aask(prompt)
        return rsp
```

#### Define Role

In many multi-agent scenarios, defining a `Role` can be as simple as 10 lines of codes. For `SimpleCoder`, we do two things:

1. Equip the `Role` with the appropriate `Action`s with `_init_actions`, this is identical to setting up a single agent
2. A multi-agent operation: we make the `Role` `_watch` important upstream messages from users or other agents. Recall our SOP, `SimpleCoder` takes user instruction, which is a `Message` caused by `UserRequirement` in MetaGPT. Therefore, we add `self._watch([UserRequirement])`.

That's all users have to do. For those who are interested in the mechanism under the hood, see [Mechanism Explained](#mechanism-explained) of this chapter.

```python
class SimpleCoder(Role):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str = "Alice",
        profile: str = "SimpleCoder",
        **kwargs,
    ):
        super().__init__(name, profile, **kwargs)
        self._watch([UserRequirement])
        self._init_actions([SimpleWriteCode])
```

---

Similar to above, for `SimpleTester`, we:

1. Equip the `SimpleTester` with `SimpleWriteTest` action using `_init_actions`
2. Make the `Role` `_watch` important upstream messages from other agents. Recall our SOP, `SimpleTester` takes main code from `SimpleCoder`, which is a `Message` caused by `SimpleWriteCode`. Therefore, we add `self._watch([SimpleWriteCode])`.
   > An extended question: Think about what it means if we use `self._watch([SimpleWriteCode, SimpleWriteReview])` instead, feel free to try this too

Additionally, we want to show that you can define your own acting logic for the agent. This applies to situation where the `Action` takes more than one input, you want to modify the input, to use particular memories, or to make any other changes to reflect specific logic. Hence, we:

3. Overwrite the `_act` function, just like what we did in a single-agent setting in [Agent101](agent_101). Here, we want `SimpleTester` to use all memories as context for writing the test cases, and we want 5 test cases.

```python
class SimpleTester(Role):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str = "Bob",
        profile: str = "SimpleTester",
        **kwargs,
    ):
        super().__init__(name, profile, **kwargs)
        self._init_actions([SimpleWriteTest])
        self._watch([SimpleWriteCode])
        # self._watch([SimpleWriteCode, SimpleWriteReview]) # feel free to try this too

    async def _act(self) -> Message:
        logger.info(f"{self._setting}: ready to {self._rc.todo}")
        todo = self._rc.todo

        # context = self.get_memories(k=1)[0].content # use the most recent memory as context
        context = self.get_memories() # use all memories as context

        code_text = await todo.run(context, k=5) # specify arguments

        msg = Message(content=code_text, role=self.profile, cause_by=todo)

        return msg
```

---

Define `SimpleReviewer` following the same procedure:

```python
class SimpleReviewer(Role):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str = "Charlie",
        profile: str = "SimpleReviewer",
        **kwargs,
    ):
        super().__init__(name, profile, **kwargs)
        self._init_actions([SimpleWriteReview])
        self._watch([SimpleWriteTest])
```

### Create a team and add roles

Now that we have defined our three `Role`s, it's time to put them together. We initialize all of them, set up a `Team`, and `hire` them.

Run the `Team`, we should see the collaboration between them!

```python
import asyncio
import typer
from metagpt.logs import logger
from metagpt.team import Team
app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def main(
    idea: str = typer.Argument(..., help="write a function that calculates the product of a list"),
    investment: float = typer.Option(default=3.0, help="Dollar amount to invest in the AI company."),
    n_round: int = typer.Option(default=5, help="Number of rounds for the simulation."),
):
    logger.info(idea)

    team = Team()
    team.hire(
        [
            SimpleCoder(),
            SimpleTester(),
            SimpleReviewer(),
        ]
    )

    team.invest(investment=investment)
    team.run_project(idea)
    asyncio.run(team.run(n_round=n_round))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

## Mechanism Explained

While users can write a few lines of code to set up a running `Role`, it's beneficial to describe the inner mechanism so that users understands the implication of the setup code and have a whole picture of the framework.

![img](/image/guide/tutorials/multi_agents_flowchart.png)

Internally, as shown in the right part of the diagram, the `Role` will `_observe` `Message` from the `Environment`. If there is a `Message` caused by the particular `Action`s the `Role` `_watch`, then it is a valid observation, triggering the `Role`'s subsequent thoughts and actions. In `_think`, the `Role` will choose one of its capable `Action`s and set it as todo. During `_act`, `Role` executes the todo, i.e., runs the `Action` and obtains the output. The output is encapsulated in a `Message` to be finally `publish_message` to the `Environment`, finishing a complete agent run.

In each step, either `_observe`, `_think`, or `_act`, the `Role` will interact with its `Memory`, through adding or retrieval. Moreover, MetaGPT provides different modes of the `react` process. For these parts, please see [Use Memories](use_memories) and [Think and act](agent_think_act)

When each `Role` is set up appropriately, we may see the corresponding SOP to the example earlier in this tutorial, demonstrated by the left half of the diagram. The dotted box suggests the SOP can be extended if we make `SimpleTester` `_watch` both `SimpleWriteCode` and `SimpleWriteReview`.

We encourage developers with interest to see the [code](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/blob/main/metagpt/roles/role.py) of `Role`, as we believe it is quite readable. Checking out `run`, `_observe`, `react`, `_think`, `_act`, `publish_message` should provide one with a decent understanding.
