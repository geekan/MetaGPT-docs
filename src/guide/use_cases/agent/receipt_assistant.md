# Recepit Assistant: Extract Structural Info from Receipts

## Role Introduction

### Function Description

Supports OCR recognition of invoice files in `pdf`, `png`, `jpg`, and `zip` formats, generating a `csv` file with information on the payee, city, total amount, and invoicing date. For single-file invoices in `pdf`, `png`, `jpg` formats, you can ask questions related to the invoice content. Additionally, multi-language support is provided for the generated invoice results.

### Design Concept

- For `pdf`, `png`, `jpg` format invoice files, use the open-source `PaddleOCR API` for OCR recognition. Extract the OCR-recognized data using the `LLM` large model and write it to a table. Finally, ask the `LLM` large model about the invoice content.
- For `zip` format invoice files, first unzip the compressed package to a specified directory. Then, recursively traverse `pdf`, `png`, `jpg` format invoice files for OCR recognition. Provide the OCR-recognized data to the `LLM` large model to extract key information into the same table. Asking questions about content is not supported for multiple files.

## Role Definition

1. Define the role class, inherit from the `Role` base class, and override the `__init__` initialization method. The `__init__` method must include the `name`, `profile`, `goal`, and `constraints` parameters. The first line of code uses `super().__init__(name, profile, goal, constraints)` to call the constructor of the parent class, implementing the initialization of the `Role`. Use `self._init_actions([InvoiceOCR])` to add initial actions and states. Here, the initial action is to add an action for OCR recognition of invoices. Custom parameters can also be added; here, the `language` parameter is added to support custom languages. Variables such as `filename`, `origin_query`, and `orc_data` are used to temporarily store the invoice file name, the original query, and the OCR recognition result, respectively. Use `self._set_react_mode(react_mode="by_order")` to set the execution order of actions to be sequential in the `_init_actions`.

   ```python
   class InvoiceOCRAssistant(Role):
       """Invoice OCR assistant, support OCR text recognition of invoice PDF, png, jpg, and zip files,
       generate a table for the payee, city, total amount, and invoicing date of the invoice,
       and ask questions for a single file based on the OCR recognition results of the invoice.

       Args:
           name: The name of the role.
           profile: The role profile description.
           goal: The goal of the role.
           constraints: Constraints or requirements for the role.
           language: The language in which the invoice table will be generated.
       """

       def __init__(
           self,
           name: str = "Stitch",
           profile: str = "Invoice OCR Assistant",
           goal: str = "OCR identifies invoice files and generates invoice main information table",
           constraints: str = "",
           language: str = "ch",
       ):
           super().__init__(name, profile, goal, constraints)
           self._init_actions([InvoiceOCR])
           self.language = language
           self.filename = ""
           self.origin_query = ""
           self.orc_data = None
           self._set_react_mode(react_mode="by_order")
   ```

2. Override the `_act` method. The `_act` method is responsible for executing actions. The `Role` class's `_react` method cyclically performs `think` and `action` operations. The `_think` method considers the next action to be performed based on the `states`. Therefore, only the `_act` method needs to be overridden. Use `msg = self._rc.memory.get(k=1)[0]` to get the latest message from the context. Use `todo = self._rc.todo` to get the next action to be executed from the context. Here, the invoice data is recognized through `InvoiceOCR`. If only a single invoice is recognized, add `GenerateTable` and `ReplyQuestion` actions. If multiple invoice files are recognized, the `ReplyQuestion` action is not needed. Use the `GenerateTable` action to provide the invoice recognition results to the `LLM` large model for extracting key information and downloading it as a table file. If it is a single invoice file, send the query and recognition results to the `LLM` large model to get the answer. The result of each action is turned into a `message`, and it is added to the context using `self._rc.memory.add(msg)`.

   ```python
   async def _act(self) -> Message:
       """Perform an action as determined by the role.

       Returns:
           A message containing the result of the action.
       """
       msg = self._rc.memory.get(k=1)[0]
       todo = self._rc.todo
       if isinstance(todo, InvoiceOCR):
           self.origin_query = msg.content
           file_path = msg.instruct_content.get("file_path")
           self.filename = file_path.name
           if not file_path:
               raise Exception("Invoice file not uploaded")

           resp = await todo.run(file_path)
           if len(resp) == 1:
               # Single file support for questioning based on OCR recognition results
               self._init_actions([GenerateTable, ReplyQuestion])
               self.orc_data = resp[0]
           else:
               self._init_actions([GenerateTable])

           self._rc.todo = None
           content = INVOICE_OCR_SUCCESS
       elif isinstance(todo, GenerateTable):
           ocr_results = msg.instruct_content
           resp = await todo.run(ocr_results, self.filename)

           # Convert list to Markdown format string
           df = pd.DataFrame(resp)
           markdown_table
   ```

## Action Definition

1. Define an `action`, where each `action` corresponds to a `class` object. Inherit from the `Action` base class and override the `__init__` initialization method. The `__init__` method includes the `name` parameter. The first line of code uses `super().__init__(name, *args, **kwargs)` to call the parent class constructor, implementing the initialization of the `action`. Here, use `args` and `kwargs` to pass other parameters to the parent class constructor, such as `context` and `llm`.

   ```python
   class InvoiceOCR(Action):
       """Action class for performing OCR on invoice files, including zip, PDF, png, and jpg files.

       Args:
           name: The name of the action. Defaults to an empty string.
           language: The language for OCR output. Defaults to "ch" (Chinese).

       """

       def __init__(self, name: str = "", *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(name, *args, **kwargs)
   ```

2. Override the `run` method. The `run` method is the main function for executing the `action`. For `InvoiceOCR`, for `pdf`, `png`, `jpg` format invoice files, use the open-source `PaddleOCR API` for OCR recognition. For `zip` format invoice files, unzip the compressed package to a specified directory, then recursively traverse `pdf`, `png`, `jpg` format invoice files, and perform OCR recognition on each file.

   ```python
   async def run(self, file_path: Path, *args, **kwargs) -> list:
       """Execute the action to identify invoice files through OCR.

       Args:
           file_path: The path to the input file.

       Returns:
           A list of OCR results.
       """
       file_ext = await self._check_file_type(file_path)

       if file_ext == ".zip":
           # OCR recognizes zip batch files
           unzip_path = await self._unzip(file_path)
           ocr_list = []
           for root, _, files in os.walk(unzip_path):
               for filename in files:
                   invoice_file_path = Path(root) / Path(filename)
                   # Identify files that match the type
                   if Path(filename).suffix in [".zip", ".pdf", ".png", ".jpg"]:
                       ocr_result = await self._ocr(str(invoice_file_path))
                       ocr_list.append(ocr_result)
           return ocr_list

       else:
           # OCR identifies single file
           ocr_result = await self._ocr(file_path)
           return [ocr_result]

   async def _check_file_type(file_path: Path) -> str:

       Args:

       Returns:
           The file type based on FileExtensionType enum.

       Raises:
           Exception: If the file format is not zip, pdf, png, or jpg.
       """
       ext = file_path.suffix
       if ext not in [".zip", ".pdf", ".png", ".jpg"]:
           raise Exception("The invoice format is not zip, pdf, png, or jpg")

       return ext

   @staticmethod
   async def _unzip(file_path: Path) -> Path:
       """Unzip a file and return the path to the unzipped directory.

       Args:
           file_path: The path to the zip file.

       Returns:

       """
       file_directory = file_path.parent / "unzip_invoices" / datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
       with zipfile.ZipFile(file_path, "r") as zip_ref:
           for zip_info in zip_ref.infolist():
               # Use CP437 to encode the file name, and then use GBK decoding to prevent Chinese garbled code
               relative_name = Path(zip_info.filename.encode("cp437").decode("gbk"))
               if relative_name.suffix:
                   full_filename = file_directory / relative_name
                   await File.write(full_filename.parent, relative_name.name, zip_ref.read(zip_info.filename))

       logger.info(f"unzip_path: {file_directory}")

   @staticmethod

       ocr_result = ocr.ocr(str(invoice_file_path), cls=True)
       return ocr_result
   ```

3. Other `action` implementations are similar. `GenerateTable` provides OCR-recognized data to the `LLM` large model to extract key information and write it to a table. `ReplyQuestion` asks the `LLM` large model about the content of the invoice.

   ```python
   class GenerateTable(Action):
       """Action class for generating tables from OCR results.

       Args:

           for ocr_result in ocr_results:

               prompt = EXTRACT_OCR_MAIN_INFO_PROMPT.format(ocr_result=ocr_result, language=self.language)
               ocr_info = await self._aask(prompt=prompt)
               invoice_data = OutputParser.extract_struct(ocr_info, dict)

![image](/image/guide/use_cases/invoice_ocr_assistant/output.png)

## Note

It is recommended to use a large text limit `llm` model `api`, such as `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`, for this role. This helps to avoid limitations when interacting with the `llm` large model due to excessively large OCR recognition results.
